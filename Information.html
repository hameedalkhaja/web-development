      in bahrain many animals are left on the streets and only one animal shelter is available. all other shelters in bahrain are privately owned, and so to combat this, we are a non-profit organization that aims 
      to take care of stray animals and sick animals in bahrain, as the weather is extremely hot in summers, many animals end up dying from dehydration or starvation.
      an issue in bahrain is that there are no trucks going around search for stray animals to get them off the street, not only is this bad for the animals but also is bad for society,
      leaving unneutered animals out in the open causes their population to increase heavily, and as many of the animals in bahrain are dogs, they may become a threat towards the safety of the citizens of bahrain.
